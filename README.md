Each repo is added as a git submodule. To add yours, create a pull request.

From the command line:

  0. Fork this repo
  1. `git clone https://github.com/<your-github-username>/HaskellBook-solutions.git`
  2. `git checkout -b add-solution`
  3. `git submodule add <url-of-your-repo> <your-github-username>`
  4. Stage and commit your changes
  5. `git push origin add-solution`
  6. [Create a pull request](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-a-pull-request/)
